Web sockets are used to ensure each account sees the same code in their IDE, and the Teacher assigns edit permissions via a \"talking stick\" mechinic, ensuring that only one account can edit the code at a time.\nThe Python code is handled in-browser by a library called Brython. The early lesson plans rely on the turtle module, so a separate \"turtle screen\" will show anytime the module is imported.",
